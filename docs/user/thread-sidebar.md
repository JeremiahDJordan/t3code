# Working with threads

Use a new thread for a separate task. Choose **New worktree** when its code changes
need a separate branch and working directory.

## Start a thread

On web and desktop, a new thread keeps the current project and carries your model
and mode selections, unless the destination project has its own model default.
Its branch and workspace mode come from your configured defaults. To continue in
an existing worktree, use **New thread in this worktree** from the branch toolbar.

When you change a new thread's project, T3 Code stays in the current environment
if that project exists there. Otherwise it selects an environment that has it.

### Start without a project

A thread does not need a project. To start one without a project, click **or
start without a project** under a new thread's heading, pick **No project** from
the project menu in that heading or from **New thread in...** in the command
palette, or press `mod+alt+n`. On mobile, pick **No project** from the project
list. To move a draft into a project, pick the project in the heading.

Each thread without a project works in its own folder under `~/.t3/scratch` (the
`scratch` folder of your T3 data directory), named after its date, the first words
of its first message, and a short id, like
`2026-09-25-convert-these-pngs-to-webp-a1b2c3d4`. Deleting a thread keeps its
folder, so the files the agent wrote stay until you delete them. Branch, worktree, and diff controls stay hidden because
these folders are not Git repositories. This is unavailable when the data
directory itself sits inside a Git checkout.

### Start in the background

In a desktop browser or the desktop app, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter`
on Windows and Linux to start a new thread and immediately open another draft. The
next draft keeps the workspace mode and base branch you selected. With **New
worktree**, each background submission creates its own worktree.

To send the same prompt to several models on web or desktop, **Shift-click** models
in a new thread's model picker to add or remove them. A regular click returns to a
single model. Choose a base branch and send. Each selection starts a separate thread
and worktree while you stay in the new thread composer. This requires a Git project.

## Pin and reorder threads

Pin a thread from its menu to keep it above your active work.

On web and desktop, unpinning, settling, snoozing, and archiving a thread each show
a notification with **Undo** for five seconds. Undo restores the thread's previous
state, including its pinned position, and reopens an archived thread you were
viewing. `mod+z` triggers the most recent Undo when no text field is focused; see
[Keybindings](./keybindings.md#commands-with-special-behavior).

On web and desktop, you can also drag files from your computer onto any thread row:
the thread opens and the files are attached in its composer, ready for
your next message. The same per-message file limits apply as when attaching
files directly; see [Attach files](./composer.md#attach-files).

On web and desktop, pinning or unpinning a thread keeps the sidebar at your current
scroll position instead of following the thread to its new place in the list.

Pinning does not prevent automatic settlement. Settling a thread removes its pin.

On web and desktop, drag a thread between sections to change its state. Drag a thread up into
the pinned section to pin it at the spot you drop it; drag a pinned thread down into the active
list to unpin it. Dragging a thread onto the **Settled** header settles it, and dragging a settled
thread into the active list un-settles it. A snoozed thread can be dragged out of the snoozed
shelf, which wakes it, but threads cannot be dragged into the shelf because snoozing needs a wake
time. Dragging a pinned thread out of the pinned section does not ask for unpin confirmation.
Pinned and active boundary labels appear only while dragging, without moving the rows. The
other rows slide aside to show where the thread will land. When you cross into another section,
the dragged thread shows the action the drop performs, with its icon: **Pin**, **Unpin**,
**Settle**, **Un-settle**, or **Wake**. Its status and hover actions hide during the drag. A pinned
thread keeps its pin only while it stays in the pinned section; once it leaves, the badge takes
over. Reordering within the same section shows no badge. When there are no pins, drag to the top
edge to pin a thread. Section labels stay readable for the whole drag, and the section the
thread is over takes the accent color. Section labels also
identify empty sections and a collapsed settled shelf.

Drag within the pinned or active section to change its order. Other rows slide aside to show the
spot where the thread will land. Drops into either section keep the position you choose. On
mobile, open a thread's menu and choose **Arrange threads**. Drag a handle within or between
**Pinned** and **Active** to reorder, pin, or unpin. Drop onto the **Settled** divider to
settle a thread. The dragged card shows the action before you release it. Expand **Snoozed**
or **Settled** to drag a parked thread back into either live section. Each drop saves; **Done** returns to the thread list.
**Move up** and **Move down** are also available in the thread menu. The server
saves the order, so it survives a refresh and appears on your other connected devices.

On web and desktop, the list also animates section changes made with thread actions such as
**Pin**, **Settle**, and **Snooze**. These transitions respect your system's reduced-motion
preference. While dragging, rows follow the insertion gap without replaying a second transition
after the drop.

New threads appear above the active threads you have arranged. Settling clears a thread's active
position, so using **Un-settle** returns it to the top. Pinning and snoozing preserve its active
position until you move it again. Thread activity does not change the order. The settled shelf
continues to use settlement time.

If dragging is unavailable for one environment, update the T3 Code server running in that
environment. Pinned and active reordering require server support. Threads from older servers keep
their default order until the server is updated.

To generate a fresh title from the conversation, open a thread's menu and choose
**Regenerate title**. The action is unavailable while title generation is in progress
or when the connected environment needs a server update.

Agents connected through T3 Code can use the same server-owned metadata workflow to
rename a thread, regenerate its title, or link and unlink a pull request. These changes
appear on web, desktop, and mobile without requiring the originating browser to remain
open.

### Fold working threads (beta)

On web and desktop, turn on **Settings → General → Working section (beta)** to move threads that
are working or monitoring into a collapsed **Working** section at the bottom of the sidebar. A
thread returns to the top of the active list when it finishes, fails, or needs an approval or
answer. Pinned threads stay in the pinned section.

While this is on, the active list is ordered by when each thread last came back to you, so you
cannot drag to reorder it. Your saved order returns when you turn it off.

## Settle finished work

Choose **Settle thread** from its menu to move finished work out of the active list
without deleting the conversation. **Un-settle thread** restores it to active work
and prevents automatic settlement until new activity resumes the usual rules.
Manually settling an idle thread dismisses unanswered async questions without
sending an answer or restarting the agent. Settling also closes the thread's
terminals that wait at an idle prompt, and keeps their output. A terminal that
runs a command, such as a dev server, stays open.

By default, environments settle inactive threads after three days and settle
threads whose pull request merged. A closed pull request can also settle an idle
thread. Work in progress, pending questions or approvals, and live background work
prevent automatic settlement. An open pull request does not prevent inactivity
settlement, but an old closed or merged pull request does not settle work you
resumed after it closed.

To keep one thread out of the settled shelf no matter how long it sits idle, open its menu,
choose **Auto-settle behavior**, and pick **Disabled**. The current option is checked. Pick
**Enabled** to return to the usual rules. Manual settle, snooze, and archive still work while it
is disabled.

Change these rules in **Settings → General** on web and desktop, or **Settings → Thread behavior** on mobile.
They continue to run when your apps are closed. On web and desktop, choose an environment at the
top to change only its rules, or **All environments** to update connected environments together.
Mixed values show where the selected environments disagree. Mobile applies these
rules to connected environments that support shared settings. Offline environments
and older servers keep their previous values. Changing a rule does not reopen
already settled threads.

## Link a pull request

The server finds the PR for each unsettled thread's saved branch, even when your
apps are closed. Settled threads keep their saved links. Update the server if
automatic branch links do not appear.

On web and desktop, right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose
**Link to thread** to select a different PR. Use **Unlink from thread** on the
same link to return to the branch PR, if one exists.
The linked pull request participates in automatic settlement.

## Find and reference work

On web and desktop, open the command palette with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to search threads
across connected environments. Message search starts after two characters and
includes your messages and final agent responses.

Use **Settings → Keybindings** to find or customize shortcuts for searching files
and copying a thread reference. A copied reference uses the thread's pull request
link when available, otherwise its thread ID. See [keybindings](./keybindings.md)
for custom configuration.

## Inspect agent work

**Limited** means the provider stopped on a usage or rate limit. The conversation
keeps the provider's explanation. Retry after the limit resets, or switch to
another provider instance.
On web and desktop, press **Resume** in an empty composer to continue a limited
or interrupted turn manually.
When a provider fails the latest turn with an error it marks as worth retrying,
such as ending the turn without a reply, the error offers **Retry** on web,
desktop and mobile. Retry sends that turn's message again, without its
attachments, using the thread's current settings.
Queued messages stay saved while the limit blocks the thread. They run after
the continuation finishes. If the queue was held by a restart, resume it then.

When the provider reports a reset time, choose **Resume at reset** to schedule a
continuation. You can cancel it from the thread. Enable **Auto-resume limited
threads** in **Settings → General** on web and desktop, or **Settings → Thread
behavior** on mobile, to schedule limit stops by default.
The environment must be running when the reset arrives; it resumes overdue
continuations after a restart. Sending a new message, archiving, or settling the
thread prevents a pending continuation from starting.

Choose **Snooze until reset** to hide the thread until its allowance returns.
Snooze and auto-resume are independent: snooze alone wakes the thread without
sending a message; enabling both wakes and continues it. **Wake now** cancels
the snooze. Enable **Snooze limited threads** in thread behavior settings to
snooze limit stops by default. Providers without a reset time offer manual
retry and the normal snooze choices.

On web and desktop, use **Agents** to follow work delegated to subagents.

Subagent threads started by the agent can't take messages; message the parent
thread instead. When such a subagent needs an approval or an answer, the parent
thread asks for it.

Expand a tool call in the conversation to see its full command and output.
Summaries shorten shell wrappers and can still describe the latest call after it
finishes; the call's own result shows its status.

## Snooze until later

Choose **Snooze → Custom…** from a thread's menu to pick a date and time in your
local time zone, or a duration in minutes, hours, or days. Durations start when
you confirm; one day means 24 hours. On web and desktop, you can also snooze
several selected threads together. Choose **Wake thread** to bring a thread back early.

## Let the agent check back later

An agent can schedule a check-in: a message T3 Code sends back into the thread later, once or
on repeat, so it can look at a long build, CI run or deploy without you asking. Ask in your own
words, such as "check on the build every 20 minutes". A check-in arrives once the agent is idle
and never interrupts or steers a turn; a repeat that falls due while the agent is still working
is skipped. Each check-in is a turn, so it uses your provider's quota. For recurring work with
no end, use [Scheduled tasks](./project-settings.md#scheduled-tasks-on-mobile) instead.

An agent can also wait on another thread in the same project, such as one it handed work to,
and hear when that thread next finishes a turn, with the end of its reply. The agent ends its
turn while it waits.

Scheduled check-ins and waits show above the composer, each with **Cancel**. What T3 Code sends
shows in the conversation as a notice, such as **Check-in: look at the build**; several that fall
due together arrive as one. A thread holds at most five check-ins, and archiving it cancels them.
Repeating check-ins and waits stop after 24 hours unless you change that in **Settings →
Integrations → Check-ins and background commands**, where you can also turn them off for all
projects or one. On mobile, open **Settings → Server settings → Agent behavior**. Turning
check-ins off stops agents scheduling new ones; cancel any already scheduled from the thread.

## Run long commands in the background

An agent can run a long command in the background, such as a build or a long test suite. It runs
on T3 Code's own tmux server, so it keeps going after the agent's turn and even if T3 Code
restarts, and its output goes to files in the folder's `.t3/jobs`, which version control
ignores. T3 Code tells the agent the moment the command ends and, if the agent asks, sends it
status updates on a schedule while it runs; those stop at the same limit as repeating check-ins.
The agent can also ask to hear about certain lines as they appear, such as failing tests, at
most every five minutes.

Running commands show above the composer with **Terminal**, which opens a terminal on the
command; **Mute**, which holds back its status updates and matching lines until you unmute it,
though the agent still hears when it ends; and **Stop**. Stopping a command gives the agent a
short turn to hear about it. Closing the command's terminal leaves it running, but Ctrl-C in that
terminal ends it. A thread with a running command does not settle on its own.

Background commands need tmux 3.2 or later on the machine running T3 Code, and the thread in
Full access, since they run outside the agent's sandbox. Archiving a thread stops its commands;
deleting it also removes their output. The check-ins switch in Settings turns them off too. If
you run the server as a systemd service, T3 Code starts tmux in its own scope so restarting the
service leaves commands running; that needs your user's systemd instance, and a service without
one needs `KillMode=process`.

T3 Code apps without this support, such as the App Store app and app.t3.codes, show the notices
in the conversation but not the scheduled check-ins, the running commands, or their buttons. From
those apps, ask the agent to cancel a check-in or stop a command, or archive the thread.
