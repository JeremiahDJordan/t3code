# Working with threads

Use a new thread for a separate task. Choose **New worktree** when its code changes
need a separate branch and working directory.

## Start a thread

On web and desktop, a new thread keeps the current project and carries your model
and mode selections, unless the destination project has its own model default.
Its branch and workspace mode come from your configured defaults. To continue in
an existing worktree, use **New thread in this worktree** from the branch toolbar.

When you change a new thread's project, T3 Code stays in the current environment
if that project exists there. Otherwise it selects an environment that has it.

### Start without a project

A thread does not need a project. To start one without a project, click **or
start without a project** under a new thread's heading, pick **No project** from
the project menu in that heading or from **New thread in...** in the command
palette, or press `mod+alt+n`. On mobile, pick **No project** from the project
list. To move a draft into a project, pick the project in the heading.

Each thread without a project works in its own folder under `~/.t3/scratch` (the
`scratch` folder of your T3 data directory), named after its date, the first words
of its first message, and a short id, like
`2026-09-25-convert-these-pngs-to-webp-a1b2c3d4`. Deleting a thread keeps its
folder, so the files the agent wrote stay until you delete them. Branch, worktree, and diff controls stay hidden because
these folders are not Git repositories. This is unavailable when the data
directory itself sits inside a Git checkout.

### Start in the background

In a desktop browser or the desktop app, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter`
on Windows and Linux to start a new thread and immediately open another draft. The
next draft keeps the workspace mode and base branch you selected. With **New
worktree**, each background submission creates its own worktree.

To send the same prompt to several models on web or desktop, **Shift-click** models
in a new thread's model picker to add or remove them. A regular click returns to a
single model. Choose a base branch and send. Each selection starts a separate thread
and worktree while you stay in the new thread composer. This requires a Git project.

## Pin and reorder threads

Pin a thread from its menu to keep it above your active work.

On web and desktop, unpinning, settling, snoozing, and archiving a thread each show
a notification with **Undo** for five seconds. Undo restores the thread's previous
state, including its pinned position, and reopens an archived thread you were
viewing. `mod+z` triggers the most recent Undo when no text field is focused; see
[Keybindings](./keybindings.md#commands-with-special-behavior).

On web and desktop, you can also drag files from your computer onto any thread row:
the thread opens and the files are attached in its composer, ready for
your next message. The same per-message file limits apply as when attaching
files directly; see [Attach files](./composer.md#attach-files).

On web and desktop, pinning or unpinning a thread keeps the sidebar at your current
scroll position instead of following the thread to its new place in the list.

Pinning does not prevent automatic settlement. Settling a thread removes its pin.

On web and desktop, drag a thread between sections to change its state. Drag a thread up into
the pinned section to pin it at the spot you drop it; drag a pinned thread down into the active
list to unpin it. Dragging a thread onto the **Settled** header settles it, and dragging a settled
thread into the active list un-settles it. A snoozed thread can be dragged out of the snoozed
shelf, which wakes it, but threads cannot be dragged into the shelf because snoozing needs a wake
time. Dragging a pinned thread out of the pinned section does not ask for unpin confirmation.
Pinned and active boundary labels appear only while dragging, without moving the rows. The
other rows slide aside to show where the thread will land. When you cross into another section,
the dragged thread shows the action the drop performs, with its icon: **Pin**, **Unpin**,
**Settle**, **Un-settle**, or **Wake**. Its status and hover actions hide during the drag. A pinned
thread keeps its pin only while it stays in the pinned section; once it leaves, the badge takes
over. Reordering within the same section shows no badge. When there are no pins, drag to the top
edge to pin a thread. Section labels stay readable for the whole drag, and the section the
thread is over takes the accent color. Section labels also
identify empty sections and a collapsed settled shelf.

Drag within the pinned or active section to change its order. Other rows slide aside to show the
spot where the thread will land. Drops into either section keep the position you choose. On
mobile, open a thread's menu and choose **Arrange threads**. Drag a handle within or between
**Pinned** and **Active** to reorder, pin, or unpin. Drop onto the **Settled** divider to
settle a thread. The dragged card shows the action before you release it. Expand **Snoozed**
or **Settled** to drag a parked thread back into either live section. Each drop saves; **Done** returns to the thread list.
**Move up** and **Move down** are also available in the thread menu. The server
saves the order, so it survives a refresh and appears on your other connected devices.

On web and desktop, the list also animates section changes made with thread actions such as
**Pin**, **Settle**, and **Snooze**. These transitions respect your system's reduced-motion
preference. While dragging, rows follow the insertion gap without replaying a second transition
after the drop.

New threads appear above the active threads you have arranged. Settling clears a thread's active
position, so using **Un-settle** returns it to the top. Pinning and snoozing preserve its active
position until you move it again. Thread activity does not change the order. The settled shelf
continues to use settlement time.

If dragging is unavailable for one environment, update the T3 Code server running in that
environment. Pinned and active reordering require server support. Threads from older servers keep
their default order until the server is updated.

### Fold working threads (beta)

On web and desktop, turn on **Settings → General → Working section (beta)** to move threads that
are working or monitoring into a collapsed **Working** section at the bottom of the sidebar. A
thread returns to the top of the active list when it finishes, fails, or needs an approval or
answer. Pinned threads stay in the pinned section.

While this is on, the active list is ordered by when each thread last came back to you, so you
cannot drag to reorder it. Your saved order returns when you turn it off.

## Settle finished work

Choose **Settle thread** from its menu to move finished work out of the active list
without deleting the conversation. **Un-settle thread** restores it to active work
and prevents automatic settlement until new activity resumes the usual rules.
Manually settling an idle thread dismisses unanswered async questions without
sending an answer or restarting the agent. Settling also closes the thread's
terminals that wait at an idle prompt, and keeps their output. A terminal that
runs a command, such as a dev server, stays open.

By default, environments settle inactive threads after three days and settle
threads whose pull request merged. A closed pull request can also settle an idle
thread. Work in progress, pending questions or approvals, and live background work
prevent automatic settlement. An open pull request does not prevent inactivity
settlement, but an old closed or merged pull request does not settle work you
resumed after it closed.

To keep one thread out of the settled shelf no matter how long it sits idle, open its menu,
choose **Auto-settle behavior**, and pick **Disabled**. The current option is checked. Pick
**Enabled** to return to the usual rules. Manual settle, snooze, and archive still work while it
is disabled.

Change these rules in **Settings → General** on web and desktop, or **Settings → Thread behavior** on mobile.
They continue to run when your apps are closed. On web and desktop, choose an environment at the
top to change only its rules, or **All environments** to update connected environments together.
Mixed values show where the selected environments disagree. Mobile applies these
rules to connected environments that support shared settings. Offline environments
and older servers keep their previous values. Changing a rule does not reopen
already settled threads.

## Link a pull request

The server finds the PR for each unsettled thread's saved branch, even when your
apps are closed. Settled threads keep their saved links. Update the server if
automatic branch links do not appear.

On web and desktop, right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose
**Link to thread** to select a different PR. Use **Unlink from thread** on the
same link to return to the branch PR, if one exists.
The linked pull request participates in automatic settlement.

## Find and reference work

On web and desktop, open the command palette with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to search threads
across connected environments. Message search starts after two characters and
includes your messages and final agent responses.

Use **Settings → Keybindings** to find or customize shortcuts for searching files
and copying a thread reference. A copied reference uses the thread's pull request
link when available, otherwise its thread ID. See [keybindings](./keybindings.md)
for custom configuration.

## Inspect agent work

On web and desktop, use **Agents** to follow work delegated to subagents.

Expand a tool call in the conversation to see its full command and output.
Summaries shorten shell wrappers and can still describe the latest call after it
finishes; the call's own result shows its status.

## Snooze until later

Choose **Snooze → Custom…** from a thread's menu to pick a date and time in your
local time zone, or a duration in minutes, hours, or days. Durations start when
you confirm; one day means 24 hours. On web and desktop, you can also snooze
several selected threads together. Choose **Wake thread** to bring a thread back early.

## Let the agent check back later

An agent can schedule a check-in: a message T3 Code sends back into the thread later, once or
on repeat, so it can look at a long build, CI run or deploy without you asking. Ask in your own
words, such as "check on the build every 20 minutes". A check-in arrives as a new turn once the
agent is idle and never interrupts a turn; a repeat that falls due while the agent is still
working is skipped. Each check-in is a turn, so it uses your provider's quota.

Scheduled check-ins show above the composer, each with **Cancel**, and the messages they send are
labeled **Check-in**. A thread holds at most five, and archiving it cancels them. Repeating
check-ins stop after 24 hours unless you change that in **Settings → Integrations → Check-ins
and background commands**, where you can also turn check-ins off for all projects or one. On
mobile, open **Settings → Server settings → Agent behavior**. Turning check-ins off stops agents
scheduling new ones; cancel any already scheduled from the thread.

An agent can also run a long command in the background, such as a build or a long test suite.
It runs on T3 Code's own tmux server, so it keeps going after the agent's turn and even if T3
Code restarts, and its output goes to files in the folder's `.t3/jobs` (git ignores them). T3
Code tells the agent the moment the command ends, and on a schedule while it runs if the agent
asks. The agent can also ask to hear about certain lines as they appear, such as failing tests,
so it can look into them before a long run finishes; those messages come at most every five
minutes. Running commands show above the composer with **Terminal**, which opens a terminal on the
command (scroll with the mouse wheel; hold Shift to select text); **Mute**, which stops the
agent's status updates and matching lines about it until you unmute it, though it still hears when
the command ends; and **Stop**. Stopping a command gives the agent a short turn to hear about
it, which uses your quota like any turn. Closing the command's terminal leaves the command
running, but Ctrl-C in that terminal ends it. Background
commands need tmux 3.2 or later on the machine running T3 Code, and the thread in Full access,
since they run outside the agent's sandbox. Archiving a thread stops its commands; deleting it
also removes their output. The same switch in Settings turns them off. While a command runs,
its thread shows as monitoring on web and desktop, and it does not settle on its own.

T3 Code apps without check-in support, such as the App Store app and app.t3.codes, show the
messages T3 Code sends for check-ins and commands, but not the scheduled check-ins, the running
commands, or their buttons. From those apps, ask the agent to cancel a check-in or stop a
command, or archive the thread. On app.t3.codes, **Stop** on the thread's **Monitoring** banner
also stops its commands.
